The colors symbolize nobility (blue), clergy (white), and bourgeois (red), which were the estates of the old regime in France. When the Tricolour was formally adopted in 1794, its colors symbolized the values of the French Revolution: liberty, equality, brotherhood, democracy, secularism, and modernization.
